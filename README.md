# HSBC Reward Points Best Deal

Easily identify which is the best deal.

Best deal is calculated as - **Number of points spent per INR**. If the ratio is less, it means you have a better deal.

## Run

Run the `index.js` script -> `node index.js` Zero Dependency script.

## Input

`input.json` is obtained from their public [Catalogue API](https://www.creditcardrewards.hsbc.co.in/api/clientProduct/VPC/catalogue) which is used to populate the data in the rewards page. I have a hard-coded JSON, just for simplicity purpose, you can call the official API if you wish to.
